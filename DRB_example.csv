2.The max temperature that the dome sees is ____ F. 
3.The minimum gap between the deflectors while cold is ____. 
4.Worst case gap for deflector to dome gap in the top and bottom wings is_____. See AvEng-444014.B
","The aero analysis showed that, in a worst-case scenario going below the current _____ deflector gap is inadvisable because the gap decreases to _____ due to thermal growth. A ____ gap showed area ratio numbers very close to those that may start choking the cooling flow. ",27-Sep-17,____ Phase 2 Deflector Thermal Growth Study,,This article will exam the gap between the deflectors in the dome assembly drawing ________ and see if there is any room to allow for an increased tolerance to give manufacturing increased relief. The thermal growth of the deflectors and the aero impact will be examined to see if they have room for increasing the tolerance. The aero impact showed that due to thermal growth when hot it would be inadvisable to increase the tolerance.  ,The purpose of this article is to see if there is any room to increase the tolerance between deflectors. ,25-Sep-17,"Zhou, Yuemin",27-Sep-17,210015000,,"Analysis found that the gap between deflectors would decrease to _____ from a min gap of _____ when subjected to hot temperatures. The aero analysis found that a side gap of _____ with a min top and bottom deflector to dome gap of _____ gave an area ratio of _____. This area ratio is very close to the 2.0 limit which is there to prevent the choking of cooling flow. Therefore, in a worst-case scenario going below the current ______ deflector gap is inadvisable.
